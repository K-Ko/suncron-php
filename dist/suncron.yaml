Location:
  # Location information is needed to calculate a correct sunrise and sunset.

  # The coordinates must be decimal degrees.
  Latitude:  59.05
  Longitude: 17.3

  #
  # Time zone information is needed to calculate a correct sunrise and sunset.
  #
  # Any valid timezone from /usr/share/zoneinfo

  # Zenith is the angle that the centre of the Sun makes to a line
  # perpendicular to the Earth's surface.

  # Each rules has the following format:
  #
  # Each rules has the following format:
  #
  # - if:    A formula like 'sunrise < 8:00'; optional, default: true
  #   then:  A formula or time
  #   else:  A formula or time; optional, default: null
  #   cron:  A crontab line NOT including minute and hour field
  #          (the first two fields).
  #
  # 'if', 'then' and 'else' may be a simple calculation
  # (like 'sunrise - 01:00')
  #
  # Try to keep formulas as simple as possible
  #
  # The 'cron' can contain variables
  #     $sunrise and $sunset for the time strings
  #     $sunrise_ts and $sunset_ts for the timestamps
  # See examples 1 & 3 below

  # Full example, force ELSE condition

  - if:   sunset < 12:00                    # Sun sets before 18:00
    then: 17:00                             # Execute at 17:00
    else: sunset - 1:00                     # Execute an hour before sunset
    cron: * * 6,7 root ls >/dev/null /root  # Run every Saturday and Sunday as root

  #
  # Do nothing in case of false
  #
  - if:   sunrise > 7:00                    # Sun rises after 7:00
    then: 6:15                              # Execute at 6:15
    cron: * * * root echo TEST>/dev/null    # Run every day as root

  # Run always
  #
  - then: sunset                            # Execute at sunrise
